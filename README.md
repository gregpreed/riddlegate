# riddlegate
Riddlegate is a little server that enables you to automate gate buzzers you often find in apartment buildings. It works in conjuction with [Twilio](http://twilio.com) (which, among other things, allows you to call webhooks when a phone number is called).

#### What you'll need for this to work:

1. A [Twilio](http://twilio.com) account and number. Twilio offers numbers for $1/month and ~$0.01 per call.
2. An externally accessible web server to run riddlegate on.
